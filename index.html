    <p> Introduction </p>
    <p id="description">Autism or autism is one of the disorders belonging to a group of developmental disorders called
        in medical
        language Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), which appears in infancy, most often before the child reaches the age
        of three years .
    </p>
    <p>Although the severity and symptoms of autism vary from one case to another, all autism disorders affect the
        child's
        ability to communicate with those around him and develop mutual relationships with them.
    </p>
    <p>Estimates show that 6 out of every 1,000 children in the United States have autism and the number of diagnosed
        cases of the disorder is constantly increasing.
    </p>
    <p>It is not yet known whether this increase is the result of more effective detection and reporting of cases, or
        is it an actual and real increase in the number of people with autism, or the result of both factors together.
    </p>
    <p>Although there is no cure for autism yet, intensive treatment and early diagnosis can make a significant and
        significant
        difference in the lives of children with this disorder.
    </p>
    <h2>The main difficulties that autistic patients suffer from</h2>
    <p>Children with autism also almost certainly suffer from difficulties in three basic developmental areas:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mutual social relations.</li>
        <li>the language.</li>
        <li>the behavior.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As children grow older towards adulthood, some of them may become more capable and willing to mix and integrate
        into the surrounding social
        environment, and they may show fewer behavioral disorders than those that characterize autism, and some of them
        may even succeed in living
        a normal life or lifestyle soon. Of normal and natural.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, others continue to have difficulties in language skills and in mutual social relationships, to
        the point that their adulthood makes their behavioral problems worse.
    </p>
    <p>Some children are slow in learning new information and skills, while others have a normal IQ , or even higher
        than other normal people. These children learn quickly, but they suffer from communication problems in applying
        things they have learned in their daily lives and in adapting to different situations.
    </p>
    <p>A very small portion of children with autism are self-educated and have unique exceptional skills, particularly
        focused in a particular field, such as: art, mathematics, or music.
    </p>
    <h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms of autism</h2>
    <img src="https://static.webteb.net/images/uploads/image-1(22).jpg" alt="Symptoms of autism">
    <p>Because the signs and symptoms of autism vary from patient to patient, two different children with the same
        medical diagnosis are likely to behave in very different ways and have completely different skills.
    </p>
    <p>However, severe cases of autism are characterized in most cases by an absolute inability to communicate or
        establish mutual relationships with other people.
    </p>
    <p>Symptoms of autism appear in most children in infancy , while other children may grow up and develop completely
        normally during the first months or years of their lives but suddenly become withdrawn, hostile, or lose the
        language skills they have acquired up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>Although every child suffers from the symptoms of autism and exhibits his own characteristics and patterns, the
        following symptoms are the most common for this type of disorder:
    </p>
    <h3>1. Disorders in social skills</h3>
    <p>The patient's symptoms appear as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He does not respond to his name being called.
        </li>
        <li>Do not make too much direct eye contact.
        </li>
        <li>He doesn't seem to hear what he's talking to.
        </li>
        <li>He rejects hugs or shrinks in on himself.
        </li>
        <li>He seems to be unaware of the feelings and emotions of others.
        </li>
        <li>He seems to like to play alone, and expects his own person in his world.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Problems with language skills</h3>
    <p>The following are the most important symptoms of language skills difficulties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He begins to speak at a later age than other children.
        </li>
        <li>He loses the ability to say certain words or phrases that he previously knew.
        </li>
        <li>Makes eye contact when he wants something specific.
        </li>
        <li>He speaks in a strange voice or with different tones and rhythms, or he speaks using a singing voice, or in
            a robot-like voice.
        </li>
        <li>He cannot initiate a conversation or continue an existing conversation.
        </li>
        <li>He may repeat words, phrases, or terms but does not know how to use them.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Behavior problems</h3>
    <p>The following are the most important symptoms of behavioral problems in an autistic patient:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning in circles, or waving hands.
        </li>
        <li>He develops habits and rituals that he always repeats.
        </li>
        <li>He loses his tranquility when any change occurs, even the simplest or smallest change, in these customs or
            rituals.
        </li>
        <li>Be always in motion .
        </li>
        <li>He is amazed and amazed by certain parts of objects, such as: the rotation of a wheel on a toy car.
        </li>
        <li>He is extremely sensitive to light, sound, or touch, but is unable to feel pain.
        </li>
        <li>Young children have difficulty when they are asked to share their experiences with others.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="causesandriskfactors">Causes and risk factors of autism</h2>
    <p>There is no single factor known to be a definitive cause of autism.</p>
    <p>But taking into account the complexity of the disease, the extent of autistic disorders, and the fact that there
        is no correspondence between two autistic conditions, that is, between two autistic children, it is likely that
        there are many factors that cause autism.
    </p>
    <h3>Causes of autism</h3>
    <p>The most important reasons that may lead to autism are:</p>
    <p>1. Genetic disorders</p>
    <p>Researchers have discovered that there are several genes that are likely to play a role in causing autism, some
        of which make the child more susceptible to developing the disorder, while others affect brain growth and
        development and the way brain cells communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <p>Any genetic defect in itself and alone may be responsible for a number of cases of autism, but in a comprehensive
        view it appears that genes in general have a very central and even decisive influence on autism disorder, and
        some genetic disorders may be transmitted genetically, while others may appear spontaneously (spontaneous).
    </p>
    <h3>2. Environmental factors</h3>
    <p>A large portion of health problems are the result of genetic and environmental factors combined, and this may be
        true in the case of autism.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, researchers are examining the possibility
        that a viral infection or environmental pollution may be a
        catalyst for the emergence and emergence of autism.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Other factors</h3>
    <p>There are other factors that have been subject to research and study recently, including: problems during
        childbirth , and the role of the immune system in everything related to autism.
    </p>
    <p>Some researchers believe that damage to the amygdala, a part of the brain that acts as a danger detector, is one
        of the factors that trigger the onset of autism.
    </p>
    <h3>Risk factors for autism</h3>
    <p>Autism may appear in any child of any origin or nationality, but there are known risk factors that increase the
        possibility of developing autism, and these factors include:
    </p>
    <h4>1. The gender of the child</h4>
    <p>Research has shown that male children are three times more likely to develop autism than female children.</p>
    <h4>2. Family history</h4>
    <p>Families who have a child with autism have a greater possibility of giving birth to another child with the
        disease, and one of the well-known and common things is that parents or relatives who have a child with autism
        suffer themselves from certain disorders in some developmental or developmental skills, or even from autistic
        behaviors. Certain.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Other disorders</h4>
    <p>Children who have certain medical problems are more likely to develop autism. These medical problems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fragile</li>
        <li>Tuberous sclerosis , which leads to the formation and development of brain tumors.</li>
        <li>The neurological disorder known as Tourette syndrome.</li>
        <li>Epilepsy, which causes seizures .</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Age of the father</h4>
    <p>Researchers tend to believe that parenting at a later age may increase the likelihood of developing autism.</p>
    <p>Very comprehensive research has shown that children born to men over the age of 40 are 6 times more likely to
        develop autism than children born to fathers under the age of 30 and the research shows that maternal age has a
        marginal effect on the likelihood of developing autism.
    </p>
    <h2 id="complications">Complications of autism</h2>
    <p>Complications of autism include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inability to succeed in studies.</li>
        <li>Social isolation.</li>
        <li>Inability to live independently.</li>
        <li>Stress.</li>
        <li>Abuse and deal with them violently.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis of autism</h2>
    <img src="https://static.webteb.net/images/uploads/image-2(7).jpg" alt="Diagnosis of autism">
    <p>The treating pediatrician conducts regular growth and development examinations with the aim of detecting
        developmental delays in the child.
    </p>
    <p>If symptoms of autism appear in a child, you can go to a doctor who specializes in treating autism, who, in
        cooperation with a team of other specialists, will carefully evaluate the disorder.
    </p>
    <p>Because autism ranges between so many degrees of disease severity and severity of symptoms, diagnosing autism can
        be a complex and complex task, as there is no specific medical test to detect an existing case of autism.
    </p>
    <h3>Diagnosis of the disease</h3>
    <p>Formal autism assessment includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>See the child by a specialist doctor.</li>
        <li>Conversing with parents about the child's social skills, linguistic abilities, and behavior , and about how
            and to what extent these factors change and develop over time.
        </li>
        <li>Subjecting the child to several examinations and tests to evaluate his speech and linguistic abilities and
            examine some psychological aspects.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although the initial symptoms of autism appear before the age of 18 months, the final diagnosis is sometimes only
        made when the child reaches the age of two or three years, when a defect in development, a delay in acquiring
        language skills, or a defect in mutual social relationships appears.
    </p>
    <p>Early diagnosis is very important, because early intervention, especially before the child reaches the age of
        three years, is a very important element in achieving the best possibilities and opportunities for improving the
        condition.
    </p>
    <h2 id="treatementsanddrugs">Treatment of autism</h2>
    <p>To this day, there is no single treatment available that is equally suitable for all people with autism. In fact,
        the variety of treatments available to patients with autism that can be adopted at home or at school is
        astonishingly diverse and numerous.
    </p>
    <p>Autism treatment includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Behavioral therapy.</li>
        <li>Speech language pathology treatments.</li>
        <li>Educational and educational treatment.</li>
        <li>Drug treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="prevention">Autism prevention</h2>
    <p>There is no way to prevent autism, but early diagnosis helps improve the behavior of a person with autism.</p>
    <h2 id="alternativetreatments">Alternative treatments</h2>
    <p>Given that autism is a very difficult and intractable condition that has no cure, many parents resort to
        solutions provided by alternative medicine.
    </p>
    <p>Although some families reported that they achieved positive results after treating autism with a special diet and
        other alternative treatments, researchers cannot confirm or deny the effectiveness of these various treatments
        on autistic patients.
    </p>
    <p>Some very common alternative treatments include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New innovative treatments.</li>
        <li>Follow their own diets.</li>
    </ul>
